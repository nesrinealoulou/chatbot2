        "long_description": "The Intel Xeon Gold 6458Q is a server/workstation processor with 32 cores, launched in January 2023, at an MSRP of $6416. It is part of the Xeon Gold lineup, using the Sapphire Rapids-SP architecture with Socket 4677. Thanks to Intel Hyper-Threading the core-count is effectively doubled, to 64 threads. To further increase overall system performance, up to two Xeon Gold 6458Q CPUs can work together in a multi-processor (SMP) configuration. Xeon Gold 6458Q has 60 MB of L3 cache and operates at 3.1 GHz by default, but can boost up to 4 GHz, depending on the workload. Intel is making the Xeon Gold 6458Q on a 10 nm production node, the transistor count is unknown. The multiplier is locked on Xeon Gold 6458Q, which limits its overclocking potential.\nWith a TDP of 350 W, the Xeon Gold 6458Q is extremely power hungry, which means you need top-notch cooling. Intel's processor supports DDR5 memory with an eight-channel interface. The highest officially supported memory speed is 4800 MT/s. ECC memory is supported, too, which is an important capability for mission-critical systems, to avoid data corruption. For communication with other components in the computer, Xeon Gold 6458Q uses a PCI-Express Gen 5 connection. This processor lacks integrated graphics, you might need a graphics card.\nHardware virtualization is available on the Xeon Gold 6458Q, which greatly improves virtual machine performance. Additionally, IOMMU virtualization (PCI passthrough) is supported, so that guest virtual machines may directly use host hardware. Programs using Advanced Vector Extensions (AVX) can run on this processor, boosting performance for calculation-heavy applications. Besides AVX, Intel has added support for the newer AVX2 and AVX-512 instructions, too.",
