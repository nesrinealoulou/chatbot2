To further increase overall system performance, up to two Xeon Platinum 8580 CPUs can link up in a multi-processor (SMP) configuration. Xeon Platinum 8580 has 300 MB of L3 cache and operates at 2000 MHz by default, but can boost up to 4 GHz, depending on the workload. Intel is building the Xeon Platinum 8580 on a 10 nm production process, the transistor count is unknown. The multiplier is locked on Xeon Platinum 8580, which limits its overclocking capabilities.\nWith a TDP of 350 W, the Xeon Platinum 8580 is extremely power hungry, which means you need top-notch cooling. Intel's processor supports DDR5 memory with an eight-channel interface. The highest officially supported memory speed is 5600 MT/s. ECC memory is supported, too, which is an important capability for mission-critical systems, to avoid data corruption. For communication with other components in the system, Xeon Platinum 8580 uses a PCI-Express Gen 5 connection. This processor lacks integrated graphics, you might need a graphics card.\nHardware virtualization is available on the Xeon Platinum 8580, which greatly improves virtual machine performance. Additionally, IOMMU virtualization (PCI passthrough) is supported, so that guest virtual machines may directly use host hardware. Programs using Advanced Vector Extensions (AVX) will run on this processor, boosting performance for calculation-heavy applications. Besides AVX, Intel has added support for the newer AVX2 and AVX-512 instructions, too.",
