It is part of the EPYC lineup, using the Zen 3 (Milan) architecture with Socket SP3. Thanks to AMD Simultaneous Multithreading (SMT) the core-count is effectively doubled, to 96 threads. EPYC 7643P has 256 MB of L3 cache and operates at 2.3 GHz by default, but can boost up to 3.6 GHz, depending on the workload. AMD is building the EPYC 7643P on a 7 nm production process using 33,200 million transistors. The silicon die of the chip is not fabricated at AMD, but at the foundry of TSMC. The multiplier is locked on EPYC 7643P, which limits its overclocking capabilities.\nWith a TDP of 225 W, the EPYC 7643P is extremely power hungry, which means you need top-notch cooling. AMD's processor supports DDR4 memory with an eight-channel interface. The highest officially supported memory speed is 3200 MT/s. ECC memory is supported, too, which is an important capability for mission-critical systems, to avoid data corruption. For communication with other components in the computer, EPYC 7643P uses a PCI-Express Gen 4 connection. This processor lacks integrated graphics, you might need a graphics card.\nHardware virtualization is available on the EPYC 7643P, which greatly improves virtual machine performance. Additionally, IOMMU virtualization (PCI passthrough) is supported, so that guest virtual machines may directly use host hardware. Programs using Advanced Vector Extensions (AVX) will run on this processor, boosting performance for calculation-heavy applications. Besides AVX, AMD is including the newer AVX2 standard, too, but not AVX-512.",
