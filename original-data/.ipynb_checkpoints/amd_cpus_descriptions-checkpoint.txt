The AMD EPYC 7663P is a server/workstation processor with 56 cores, launched in September 2023, at an MSRP of $3139. It is part of the EPYC lineup, using the Zen 3 (Milan) architecture with Socket SP3. Thanks to AMD Simultaneous Multithreading (SMT) the core-count is effectively doubled, to 112 threads. EPYC 7663P has 256 MB of L3 cache and operates at 2000 MHz by default, but can boost up to 3.5 GHz, depending on the workload. AMD is making the EPYC 7663P on a 7 nm production node using 33,200 million transistors. The silicon die of the chip is not fabricated at AMD, but at the foundry of TSMC. The multiplier is locked on EPYC 7663P, which limits its overclocking potential.
With a TDP of 240 W, the EPYC 7663P is extremely power hungry, which means you need top-notch cooling. AMD's processor supports DDR4 memory with an eight-channel interface. The highest officially supported memory speed is 3200 MT/s. ECC memory is supported, too, which is an important capability for mission-critical systems, to avoid data corruption. For communication with other components in the machine, EPYC 7663P uses a PCI-Express Gen 4 connection. This processor lacks integrated graphics, you might need a graphics card.
Hardware virtualization is available on the EPYC 7663P, which greatly improves virtual machine performance. Additionally, IOMMU virtualization (PCI passthrough) is supported, so that guest virtual machines may directly use host hardware. Programs using Advanced Vector Extensions (AVX) can run on this processor, boosting performance for calculation-heavy applications. Besides AVX, AMD is including the newer AVX2 standard, too, but not AVX-512.

The AMD EPYC 7713 is a server/workstation processor with 64 cores, launched in March 2021, at an MSRP of $7060. It is part of the EPYC lineup, using the Zen 3 (Milan) architecture with Socket SP3. Thanks to AMD Simultaneous Multithreading (SMT) the core-count is effectively doubled, to 128 threads. To further increase overall system performance, up to two EPYC 7713 CPUs can work together in a multi-processor (SMP) configuration. EPYC 7713 has 256 MB of L3 cache and operates at 2000 MHz by default, but can boost up to 3.675 GHz, depending on the workload. AMD is making the EPYC 7713 on a 7 nm production node using 33,200 million transistors. The silicon die of the chip is not fabricated at AMD, but at the foundry of TSMC. The multiplier is locked on EPYC 7713, which limits its overclocking potential.
With a TDP of 225 W, the EPYC 7713 is extremely power hungry, which means you need top-notch cooling. AMD's processor supports DDR4 memory with an eight-channel interface. The highest officially supported memory speed is 3200 MT/s. ECC memory is supported, too, which is an important capability for mission-critical systems, to avoid data corruption.
