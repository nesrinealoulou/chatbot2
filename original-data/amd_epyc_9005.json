AMD's processor supports DDR5 memory with a twelve-channel interface. The highest officially supported memory speed is 6000 MT/s. ECC memory is supported, too, which is an important capability for mission-critical systems, to avoid data corruption. For communication with other components in the machine, EPYC 9645 uses a PCI-Express Gen 5 connection. This processor lacks integrated graphics, you might need a graphics card.\nHardware virtualization is available on the EPYC 9645, which greatly improves virtual machine performance. Programs using Advanced Vector Extensions (AVX) can run on this processor, boosting performance for calculation-heavy applications.
