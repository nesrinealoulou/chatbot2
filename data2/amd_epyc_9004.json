The multiplier is locked on EPYC 9374F, which limits its overclocking capabilities.\nWith a TDP of 320 W, the EPYC 9374F is extremely power hungry, which means you need top-notch cooling. AMD's processor supports DDR5 memory with a twelve-channel interface. The highest officially supported memory speed is 4800 MT/s. ECC memory is supported, too, which is an important capability for mission-critical systems, to avoid data corruption. For communication with other components in the computer, EPYC 9374F uses a PCI-Express Gen 5 connection. This processor lacks integrated graphics, you might need a graphics card.\nHardware virtualization is available on the EPYC 9374F, which greatly improves virtual machine performance. Programs using Advanced Vector Extensions (AVX) will run on this processor, boosting performance for calculation-heavy applications. Besides AVX, AMD has added support for the newer AVX2 and AVX-512 instructions, too."
