ECC memory is supported, too, which is an important capability for mission-critical systems, to avoid data corruption. For communication with other components in the machine, Xeon Gold 5512U uses a PCI-Express Gen 5 connection. This processor lacks integrated graphics, you might need a graphics card.\nHardware virtualization is available on the Xeon Gold 5512U, which greatly improves virtual machine performance. Additionally, IOMMU virtualization (PCI passthrough) is supported, so that guest virtual machines may directly use host hardware.

To further increase overall system performance, up to two Xeon Platinum 8558 CPUs can link up in a multi-processor (SMP) configuration. Xeon Platinum 8558 has 260 MB of L3 cache and operates at 2.1 GHz by default, but can boost up to 4 GHz, depending on the workload. Intel is building the Xeon Platinum 8558 on a 10 nm production process, the transistor count is unknown. The multiplier is locked on Xeon Platinum 8558, which limits its overclocking capabilities.\nWith a TDP of 330 W, the Xeon Platinum 8558 is extremely power hungry, which means you need top-notch cooling. Intel's processor supports DDR5 memory with an eight-channel interface. The highest officially supported memory speed is 5200 MT/s. ECC memory is supported, too, which is an important capability for mission-critical systems, to avoid data corruption. For communication with other components in the machine, Xeon Platinum 8558 uses a PCI-Express Gen 5 connection. This processor lacks integrated graphics, you might need a graphics card.\nHardware virtualization is available on the Xeon Platinum 8558, which greatly improves virtual machine performance. Additionally, IOMMU virtualization (PCI passthrough) is supported, so that guest virtual machines may directly use host hardware. Programs using Advanced Vector Extensions (AVX) will run on this processor, boosting performance for calculation-heavy applications. Besides AVX, Intel has added support for the newer AVX2 and AVX-512 instructions, too."

    "description": "The Intel Xeon Platinum 8592+ is a server/workstation processor with 64 cores, launched in December 2023, at an MSRP of $11600. It is part of the Xeon Platinum lineup, using the Emerald Rapids-SP architecture with Socket 4677. Thanks to Intel Hyper-Threading the core-count is effectively doubled, to 128 threads. To further increase overall system performance, up to two Xeon Platinum 8592+ CPUs can work together in a multi-processor (SMP) configuration. Xeon Platinum 8592+ has 320 MB of L3 cache and operates at 1900 MHz by default, but can boost up to 3.9 GHz, depending on the workload. Intel is making the Xeon Platinum 8592+ on a 10 nm production node, the transistor count is unknown. The multiplier is locked on Xeon Platinum 8592+, which limits its overclocking potential.\nWith a TDP of 350 W, the Xeon Platinum 8592+ is extremely power hungry, which means you need top-notch cooling. Intel's processor supports DDR5 memory with an eight-channel interface. The highest officially supported memory speed is 5600 MT/s. ECC memory is supported, too, which is an important capability for mission-critical systems, to avoid data corruption. For communication with other components in the computer, Xeon Platinum 8592+ uses a PCI-Express Gen 5 connection. This processor lacks integrated graphics, you might need a graphics card.\nHardware virtualization is available on the Xeon Platinum 8592+, which greatly improves virtual machine performance. Additionally, IOMMU virtualization (PCI passthrough) is supported, so that guest virtual machines may directly use host hardware. Programs using Advanced Vector Extensions (AVX) can run on this processor, boosting performance for calculation-heavy applications. Besides AVX, Intel has added support for the newer AVX2 and AVX-512 instructions, too."
