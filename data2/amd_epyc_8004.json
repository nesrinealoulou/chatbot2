EPYC 8534PN has 128 MB of L3 cache and operates at 2000 MHz by default, but can boost up to 3.1 GHz, depending on the workload. AMD is building the EPYC 8534PN on a 5 nm production process using 35,500 million transistors. The silicon die of the chip is not fabricated at AMD, but at the foundry of TSMC. The multiplier is locked on EPYC 8534PN, which limits its overclocking capabilities.\nWith a TDP of 175 W, the EPYC 8534PN is extremely power hungry, which means you need top-notch cooling. AMD's processor supports DDR5 memory with a six-channel interface. The highest officially supported memory speed is 4800 MT/s. ECC memory is supported, too, which is an important capability for mission-critical systems, to avoid data corruption. For communication with other components in the system, EPYC 8534PN uses a PCI-Express Gen 5 connection. This processor lacks integrated graphics, you might need a graphics card.\nHardware virtualization is available on the EPYC 8534PN, which greatly improves virtual machine performance. Programs using Advanced Vector Extensions (AVX) will run on this processor, boosting performance for calculation-heavy applications.
