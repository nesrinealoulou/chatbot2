To further increase overall system performance, up to two Xeon 6745P CPUs can work together in a multi-processor (SMP) configuration.

Intel is making the Xeon 6745P on a 5 nm production node, the transistor count is unknown. The multiplier is locked on Xeon 6745P, which limits its overclocking potential.\nWith a TDP of 300 W, the Xeon 6745P is extremely power hungry, which means you need top-notch cooling. Intel's processor supports DDR5 memory with an eight-channel interface. The highest officially supported memory speed is 6400 MT/s. ECC memory is supported, too, which is an important capability for mission-critical systems, to avoid data corruption. For communication with other components in the system, Xeon 6745P uses a PCI-Express Gen 5 connection. This processor lacks integrated graphics, you might need a graphics card.\nHardware virtualization is available on the Xeon 6745P, which greatly improves virtual machine performance. Additionally, IOMMU virtualization (PCI passthrough) is supported, so that guest virtual machines may directly use host hardware. Programs using Advanced Vector Extensions (AVX) can run on this processor, boosting performance for calculation-heavy applications. Besides AVX, Intel has added support for the newer AVX2 and AVX-512 instructions, too."

To further increase overall system performance, up to two Xeon 6726P-B CPUs can work together in a multi-processor (SMP) configuration. Xeon 6726P-B has 168 MB of L3 cache and operates at 2.3 GHz by default, but can boost up to 3.5 GHz, depending on the workload. Intel is making the Xeon 6726P-B on a 5 nm production node, the transistor count is unknown. The multiplier is locked on Xeon 6726P-B, which limits its overclocking potential.\nWith a TDP of 235 W, the Xeon 6726P-B is extremely power hungry, which means you need top-notch cooling. Intel's processor supports DDR5 memory with a quad-channel interface. The highest officially supported memory speed is 6400 MT/s. ECC memory is supported, too, which is an important capability for mission-critical systems, to avoid data corruption. For communication with other components in the computer, Xeon 6726P-B uses a PCI-Express Gen 5 connection. This processor lacks integrated graphics, you might need a graphics card.\nHardware virtualization is available on the Xeon 6726P-B, which greatly improves virtual machine performance. Additionally, IOMMU virtualization (PCI passthrough) is supported, so that guest virtual machines may directly use host hardware. Programs using Advanced Vector Extensions (AVX) can run on this processor, boosting performance for calculation-heavy applications. Besides AVX, Intel has added support for the newer AVX2 and AVX-512 instructions, too."

To further increase overall system performance, up to eight Xeon 6748P CPUs can link up in a multi-processor (SMP) configuration.

Intel is building the Xeon 6748P on a 5 nm production process, the transistor count is unknown. The multiplier is locked on Xeon 6748P, which limits its overclocking capabilities.\nWith a TDP of 300 W, the Xeon 6748P is extremely power hungry, which means you need top-notch cooling. Intel's processor supports DDR5 memory with an eight-channel interface. The highest officially supported memory speed is 6400 MT/s. ECC memory is supported, too, which is an important capability for mission-critical systems, to avoid data corruption. For communication with other components in the machine, Xeon 6748P uses a PCI-Express Gen 5 connection. This processor lacks integrated graphics, you might need a graphics card.\nHardware virtualization is available on the Xeon 6748P, which greatly improves virtual machine performance. Additionally, IOMMU virtualization (PCI passthrough) is supported, so that guest virtual machines may directly use host hardware. Programs using Advanced Vector Extensions (AVX) will run on this processor, boosting performance for calculation-heavy applications. Besides AVX, Intel has added support for the newer AVX2 and AVX-512 instructions, too."

    "description": "The Intel Xeon 6756E is a server/workstation processor with 128 cores, launched in June 2024, at an MSRP of $8428. It is part of the Xeon 6 lineup, using the Sierra Forest-SP architecture with Socket 4710. To further increase overall system performance, up to two Xeon 6756E CPUs can work together in a multi-processor (SMP) configuration. Xeon 6756E has 96 MB of L3 cache and operates at 1800 MHz by default, but can boost up to 2.6 GHz, depending on the workload. Intel is making the Xeon 6756E on a 5 nm production node, the transistor count is unknown. The multiplier is locked on Xeon 6756E, which limits its overclocking potential.\nWith a TDP of 225 W, the Xeon 6756E is extremely power hungry, which means you need top-notch cooling. Intel's processor supports DDR5 memory with an eight-channel interface. The highest officially supported memory speed is 6400 MT/s. ECC memory is supported, too, which is an important capability for mission-critical systems, to avoid data corruption. For communication with other components in the machine, Xeon 6756E uses a PCI-Express Gen 5 connection. This processor lacks integrated graphics, you might need a graphics card.\nHardware virtualization is available on the Xeon 6756E, which greatly improves virtual machine performance. Additionally, IOMMU virtualization (PCI passthrough) is supported, so that guest virtual machines may directly use host hardware. Programs using Advanced Vector Extensions (AVX) can run on this processor, boosting performance for calculation-heavy applications. Besides AVX, Intel is including the newer AVX2 standard, too, but not AVX-512."
