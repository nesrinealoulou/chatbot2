    "question": "comapare Xeonn 9564 vs Epycc 9754?",
    "expected_answer": "intel xeon 9564 does not exist , however The AMD EPYC 9754 is a server/workstation processor with 128 cores, launched in June 2023, at an MSRP of $11900. It is part of the EPYC lineup, using the Zen 4c (Bergamo) architecture with Socket SP5.",
    "model_answer": "The AMD EPYC 9754 and Intel Xeon 9564 are both high-end server/workstation processors, but they have some key differences.\n\nThe AMD EPYC 9754 has 128 cores and 256 threads, while the Intel Xeon 9564 has 72 cores and 144 threads. This means the EPYC 9754 has more cores and threads, which can lead to better performance in multi-threaded workloads.\n\nThe EPYC 9754 is built on the Zen 4c (Bergamo) architecture with a 5 nm production process, while the Xeon 9564 is built on the Ice Lake architecture with a 10 nm production process. The smaller 5 nm process of the EPYC 9754 allows for more transistors (71,000 million) compared to the Xeon 9564 (56,000 million).\n\nThe EPYC 9754 has a base clock of 2.25 GHz and a boost clock of 3.1 GHz, while the Xeon 9564 has a base clock of 3.15 GHz and a boost clock of 4.2 GHz. This means the Xeon 9564 can reach higher clock speeds, which can lead to better performance in single-threaded workloads.\n\nBoth processors support DDR5 memory with a twelve-channel interface, but the EPYC 9754 has a higher officially supported memory speed of 4800 MT/s compared to the Xeon 9564's 6000 MT/s.\n\nIn terms of power consumption, the EPYC 9754 has a TDP of 360 W, while the Xeon 9564 has a TDP of 400 W. This means the EPYC 9754 is slightly less power-hungry, which can be beneficial for cooling and power costs.\n\nIn summary, the AMD EPYC 9754 has more cores and threads, a smaller production process, and slightly lower power consumption, while"
